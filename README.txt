HOW TO PLAY

"Out of Sync" is no ordinary 2D platformer. You control two avatars at once in two separate "dimensions,"
and you can only view one dimension at a time. Any movement one avatar makes in one dimension will be
copied in the other dimension. Thus, you must navigate carefully to make sure both avatars make it to the
end of the levels safely; for if one avatar dies, the other dies as well.

 - Hitting spikes instantly restarts the level
 - The black oval signifies the level ending. The level is beaten once both avatars reach their
   respective ovals.

CONTROLS
 - WASD to move
 - Space bar to view the alternate dimension and avatar.

HINT FOR LEVELS 1 AND 2:
 - The game's title is the hint.

A NOTE ON LEVEL 2
 - Level 2 was challenging to design, and is probably even more challenging to solve; for sake of time, I
   would not recommend attempting it.
